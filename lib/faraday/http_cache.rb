module Faraday
  # Public: The middleware responsible for caching and serving responses.
  # The middleware use the provided configuration options to establish a
  # 'Faraday::HttpCache::Storage' to cache responses retrieved by the stack
  # adapter. If a stored response can be served again for a subsequent
  # request, the middleware will return the response instead of issuing a new
  # request to it's server. This middleware should be the last attached handler
  # to your stack, so it will be closest to the inner app, avoiding issues
  # with other middlewares on your stack.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   # Using the middleware with a simple client:
  #   client = Faraday.new do |builder|
  #     builder.user :http_cache
  #     builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
  #   end
  #
  #   # Attach a Logger to the middleware.
  #   client = Faraday.new do |builder|
  #     builder.use :http_cache, :logger => my_logger_instance
  #     builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
  #   end
  #
  #   # Provide an existing CacheStore (for instance, from a Rails app)
  #   client = Faraday.new do |builder|
  #     builder.use :http_cache, Rails.cache
  #   end
